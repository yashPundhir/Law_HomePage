## About Me

**Hey, I'm Yash Pundhir**

- I'm 23 and I live in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. I'm currently learning **Full Stack Web Development** in `MERN` Stack.

---

## Project Description

- In this project I have built a **Law HomePage** from the scratch using core `HTML` & `CSS`

- This project heavily relies on `float` property, `border` property & `object-fit` property of `CSS`.

- Note that I haven't made it **Responsive** to **Different Screen Sizes**, so it will work only on the laptop screen. If you are using Desktop, please zoom in or out, that might work.

## Technologies Used

- HTML

- CSS

## What I have Learnt in this Project

- Good understanding of `HTML` & `CSS`.

- `float` property of `CSS`:

  - how the `float` property can be used to **align the corresponding elements on the screen wrt the position of the current element**.

  - how we can use the `float` property to make 2 `div` come together in a row without using `CSS Flexbox`

- `object-fit` property of `CSS`:

  - how the `object-fit` property can be used to insert an image inside a container properly without eliminating the useful part of the image.

- **Next & Prev** Buttons of Footer:

  - learnt about how the property `position: absolute` can be used to **align an image** at any **desired location** on the entire webpage using the properties: `top, left, right, bottom` by setting the **desired coordinates**.

## Time Taken to Finish this Project

> I took around **2 hour** to complete this project. The only thing that has taken much time to be implemented is how to create the **Next & Prev** Buttons of Footer bcz .

---

I'm definitely more confident now in creating a webpage similar to this one.
